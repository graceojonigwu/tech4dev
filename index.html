            <p>According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), about 230 million jobs in Sub-Saharan Africa will require digital skills by 2030. 
                This figure is due to increasing use of technology and automation of jobs. At Tech4Dev, we prepare people for the future of work by creating opportunities for decent work through technology-based training, 
                which include coding skills, deep tech skills, employability skills and basic digital skills</p>
